      <P>
        Published by <A href="https://vitalcitynyc.org/">Vital City</A>, an independent New York policy journal.
        NYC CompStat Decoder reads the NYPD&rsquo;s weekly CompStat report and puts the week&rsquo;s numbers in
        longer-run and geographic context. The project is open source. Everything on this site traces to one of
        the sources described below; each note says what the data covers, where it comes from, and what was done to it.
      </P>

      <H>The CompStat report</H>
      <P>
        The core source is the NYPD&rsquo;s weekly CompStat 2.0 report, scraped
        from <A href="https://compstat.nypdonline.org/">compstat.nypdonline.org</A> by an automated pipeline each
        Monday after the NYPD posts it. The report covers the seven major felonies plus additional offenses
        (shootings, misdemeanor assault, petit larceny, retail theft, hate crimes, and transit and housing
        totals) for the city as a whole, the eight patrol boroughs, and all 77 precincts, with week,
        28-day, and year-to-date comparisons against the same period a year earlier.
      </P>
      <P>
        Nearly every count and percent change on the dashboard comes from this report. If the live feed is
        unreachable, the site falls back to an embedded snapshot of a recent week and says so in the footer below.
      </P>

      <H>Historical series, 1993&ndash;2025</H>
      <P>
        Annual counts of the seven major felonies and shooting incidents, citywide and by precinct, drive the
        &ldquo;trend since 1993&rdquo; sparklines and the long-run context throughout the dashboard. These come
        from the NYPD&rsquo;s <A href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/historical.page">Historical
        New York City Crime Data</A>, which the department updates each year. They can differ slightly from FBI
        Uniform Crime Reporting figures for the same years.
      </P>

      <H>NYC Open Data</H>
      <P>
        Three live queries go to the city&rsquo;s open data portal, each for a specific feature:
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Transit offense breakdown.</strong> The by-offense table under In Transit queries the NYPD
        complaint data, current year (<Code>5uac-w243</Code>) and historic (<Code>qgea-i56i</Code>), filtered
        to complaints carrying a transit-district code, and compares the same calendar window in the prior
        year. Complaint data is a different reporting stream from CompStat: it counts complaints as recorded
        and is subject to revision, so these figures will not exactly match the CompStat transit totals shown
        above them.
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Shooting incidents.</strong> The map under By Council District plots the NYPD Shooting
        Incident Data, year to date (<Code>5ucz-vwe8</Code>), at the incident level. The latitude and
        longitude fields are transposed in the source dataset; the site corrects for this.
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Precinct locator.</strong> The &ldquo;locate me&rdquo; button checks the visitor&rsquo;s
        position against the police precinct boundary file (<Code>78dh-3ptz</Code>) to select a precinct.
        Location is used for that lookup only and is not stored.
      </P>

      <H>Transit homicides</H>
      <P>
        Murders are never coded to a transit district in the complaint-level extract (in 2024, none of the
        382 citywide murder complaints carried one), so the transit homicide figures under In Transit
        cannot come from the query above. They are hand-entered full-year counts, 2022 through 2025, taken
        from NYPD year-end announcements and contemporaneous coverage, with each source cited alongside them.
        They are not a live feed and update only when edited.
      </P>

      <H>Peer cities</H>
      <P>
        The city comparison on the home page uses the <A href="https://realtimecrimeindex.com/">Real-Time
        Crime Index</A> by AH Datalytics, a monthly compilation of open crime data from several hundred U.S.
        cities. Rates per 100,000 use the population figures RTCI publishes. Cities that have not yet
        reported for the displayed period are excluded rather than shown as zero. If the live file is
        unreachable, an embedded snapshot is shown with its date noted.
      </P>

      <H>Populations and rates</H>
      <P>
        Per-100,000 rates use 2020 decennial Census populations, allocated to precincts
        via <A href="https://github.com/jkeefe/census-by-precincts">John Keefe&rsquo;s census-by-precincts
        crosswalk</A>; patrol borough populations are sums of their precincts, and the citywide figure is
        8,804,190. Rates reflect residential population. The three &ldquo;tourist hub&rdquo; precincts
        (14th, 18th, and 22nd) have daytime populations far above their residential ones, most extremely
        the 22nd (Central Park, 129 residents), so their rates carry a hatch overlay as a warning; percent
        changes are unaffected.
      </P>

      <H>Council districts</H>
      <P>
        District boundaries are the official 2023 City Council lines from NYC Open Data, and member names
        come from <A href="https://council.nyc.gov/districts/">council.nyc.gov</A>. Because the NYPD reports
        by precinct, not by district, each district&rsquo;s figures are built by weighting its precincts&rsquo;
        year-to-date CompStat counts by the share of the district&rsquo;s land area falling in each precinct
        (overlaps under 2 percent are dropped as boundary slivers). This is an approximation: it assumes
        crime is spread evenly within a precinct. District figures are always year to date, since weekly
        counts are too small at that geography to be meaningful.
      </P>

      <H>The 30-year page</H>
      <P>
        The &ldquo;30-Year Transformation&rdquo; page draws on the same historical series, plus citywide
        misdemeanor assault counts for 2000&ndash;2024 from the NYPD&rsquo;s historical misdemeanor tables.
        Its precinct scatterplot pairs precinct poverty rates against per-100,000 offense rates; Vital City
        has not independently verified those underlying figures, and they should be read as illustrative.
      </P>
